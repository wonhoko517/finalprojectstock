### **Future Value Analysis of Mediocre Social Network Apps Incorporated**


From 2015 to 2019, the media industry has gone through various big changes with people’s changing needs and preferences. 

Previously, people’s preferences changed from traditional media (including printed materials like books, magazines, and newspapers) to new media (electronic video games and entertainment and the Internet/social media) with the innovation of the Internet and new media technology. Just like people’s preferences in media changed from traditional media to new media, people’s demand for DVDs changed to online download after the boom of the internet. People’s preferences constantly change over time, and from 2015 to 2019 people’s demand for online streaming over online download marks the dawn of a new media era. People demand a quicker and simpler way of communicating with one another and a quicker way to enjoy entertainment online (online streaming). From the era of Facebook to Snapchat/Instagram and DVDs to Netflix/Amazon Prime Video/Disney+, people constantly want quicker and efficient way to communicate through the internet/social media. With people’s demand for a new form of media, Mediocre Social Network Apps Incorporated has struggled for a few years as people's preferences change.
